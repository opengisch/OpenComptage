* Development manual
** Data model
   The data model has been created to easily allow to add functionality to the product
   e.g. adding new vehicle classes and to be as simple as possible and easily
   usable into QGIS. It is flexible enough to support natively all the current
   special cases without write special management code.
  
   The data model is created with ~pgmodeler~ and is exported into an sql script
   used by ~create_db.sh~ script. To create a new sql from the pgmodeler's model,
   run the script ~create_data_model_sql_script.sh~.
